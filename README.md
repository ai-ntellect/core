## 1. Main components

The system relies on several key components that ensure smooth and efficient management of actions and the overall workflow process.

### Orchestrator

The orchestrator is responsible for managing the execution of actions within a workflow. It analyzes the needs based on inputs (like the user prompt) and decides the order of actions to be performed. It interacts with other components like the cache memory and events to organize the execution of tasks.

- **Main Role**: Organize and direct the execution of actions.
- **Interactions**:
  - Analyzes user prompts to determine required actions
  - Requests actions to be executed
  - Uses cache memory to avoid redundancy
  - Emits events to inform other components about the state of the workflow

### Queue Manager

The queue manager organizes the actions to be executed and manages their execution order. It ensures a smooth flow of execution by adding actions to the queue based on the priorities defined by the orchestrator.

- **Main Role**: Manage the action queue and ensure actions are executed in the correct order.
- **Main Functions**:
  - Add new actions to the queue.
  - Manage action priorities.
  - Ensure proper and timely execution of actions.

### Synthesizer

The synthesizer is responsible for generating responses and analyzing actions based on the results obtained in the workflow. It can create summaries or more complex responses from the raw results obtained during the execution of actions.

- **Main Role**: Transform the results of actions into a comprehensible and structured output
- **Interactions**:
  - Takes the results of executed actions
  - Creates summaries or tailored responses
  - Formats final output for user consumption
  - Can handle streaming responses

### Evaluator

The evaluator is responsible for assessing the results of executed actions and determining if additional actions are needed. It works in conjunction with the orchestrator to ensure all user requirements are met.

- **Main Role**: Evaluate action results and determine next steps
- **Main Functions**:
  - Analyzes results from executed actions
  - Determines if additional actions are needed
  - Suggests next actions to the orchestrator
  - Ensures completion of user requirements
- **Interactions**:
  - Works with orchestrator to manage workflow
  - Processes action results
  - Can trigger additional action cycles

### Memory

The system implements a sophisticated memory architecture that combines different storage solutions for various types of memory:

#### Installation and setup

##### Meilisearch (Long-term memory)

Meilisearch can be self-hosted for complete control over the agent's long-term memory:

```bash
# Install Meilisearch
curl -L https://install.meilisearch.com | sh

# Launch Meilisearch with a master key
./meilisearch --master-key="YOUR_MASTER_KEY"
```

##### Redis (Short-term memory)

Redis handles the short-term memory components:

```bash
# Using Docker
docker run --name redis -d -p 6379:6379 redis

# Or install locally
sudo apt-get install redis-server
```

2. **Configuration**:
   - Default port: 6379
   - Configure memory limits
   - Enable persistence if needed

#### Memory types

#### Short-term memory (Redis)

1. **Procedural Memory**:

   - Stored in Redis for fast access
   - Contains reusable action sequences and workflows
   - Optimizes performance through caching
   - Example: "Common token approval + swap sequence"

2. **Short-term episodic memory**:
   - Recent messages and interactions
   - Temporary context for ongoing conversations
   - Stored in Redis for quick retrieval
   - Example: "Last 10 messages in current conversation"

#### Long-term memory (Meilisearch)

1. **Semantic memory**:

   - Permanent storage of facts and knowledge
   - Indexed for efficient retrieval
   - Stores relationships between concepts
   - Example: "Token X has contract address Y on network Z"

2. **Long-term episodic Memory**:
   - Historical interactions and experiences
   - Persistent context across sessions
   - Searchable through vector similarity
   - Example: "User X's past successful transactions"

### Cache Augmented Generation (CAG)

CAG optimizes workflow execution through Redis-based caching:

- **Main Role**: Cache frequently used procedural patterns
- **Implementation**:

  - Uses Redis for high-performance storage
  - Stores action sequences and their results
  - Enables quick retrieval of common patterns

- **Benefits**:
  - Reduces computation overhead
  - Speeds up repeated operations
  - Optimizes resource usage

### Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)

The RAG system enhances long-term memory access through Meilisearch:

- **Implementation**:

  - Vector-based search for semantic similarity
  - Dual indexing (global and user-specific)
  - Combines with traditional text search

- **Features**:
  - Semantic and episodic memory retrieval
  - Context-aware search capabilities
  - Relevance-based result ranking

## 2. Action creation and management

Actions are specific tasks to be performed within a workflow. They can involve interactions with APIs, blockchain transactions, or any other necessary operations.

Each action is defined as an object containing a name, description, parameters, and an execution function.

### Example of an action

```typescript
import { networkConfigs } from "@config/network";
import { parseEther } from "ethers";
import { z } from "zod";

export const prepareTransaction = {
  name: "prepare-transaction",
  description: "Prepare a transfer for the user to sign.",
  parameters: z.object({
    walletAddress: z.string(),
    amount: z.string().describe("Amount to send"),
    networkId: z.string().describe("Target network (e.g., ethereum, arbitrum)"),
  }),
  execute: async ({
    walletAddress,
    amount,
    network,
  }: {
    walletAddress: string;
    amount: string;
    networkId: string;
  }) => {
    try {
      const networkConfig = networkConfigs[networkId];
      if (!networkConfig) {
        throw new Error(`Network ${network} not found`);
      }

      return {
        to: walletAddress,
        value: parseEther(amount).toString(),
        chain: {
          id: networkConfig.id,
          rpc: networkConfig.rpc,
        },
        type: "transfer",
      };
    } catch (error) {
      return "Error preparing the transaction";
    }
  },
};
```

### How to define an action:

1. **Name**: Unique identifier for the action.
2. **Description**: Brief description of what the action does.
3. **Parameters**: Parameters required to execute the action, validated by `zod`.
4. **Execution**: `execute` function that performs the action.

---

## 3. Workflow execution

The workflow represents the entire process of executing a number of defined actions. When a user sends a prompt, the orchestrator determines which actions to perform based on the needs.

### Example of creating a workflow:

```typescript
const tools = [
  prepareEvmTransaction,
  getNews, // Example action to fetch the latest news
];

const orchestrator = new Orchestrator(tools);

const workflow = new Workflow(
  { id: from }, // User ID or context
  { orchestrator, memoryCache, eventEmitter } // Required components
);
```

- **Orchestrator**: Manages the order of actions.
- **MemoryCache**: Reuses previous results.
- **EventEmitter**: Tracks and notifies the state of the workflow.

### Workflow process:

1. The userâ€™s prompt is analyzed.
2. The orchestrator decides which actions are needed and their order.
3. Actions are executed.
4. Results are synthesized and returned to the user.

## 4. API calls and client side

```typescript
fastify.post("/api/chat", {
  preHandler: requireAuth,
  handler: async (request, reply) => {
    const { messages, from } = request.body;
    const latestMessage = messages[messages.length - 1];

    const workflow = new Workflow(
      { id: from },
      { orchestrator, memoryCache, eventEmitter }
    );
    return workflow.start(latestMessage.content, messages);
  },
});
```

```typescript
export function Chat({ id, initialMessages }) {
  const { messages, setMessages, handleSubmit, input, setInput } = useChat({
    api: "/api/chat",
    body: { id, from: activeAccount?.address },
  });

  return (
    <div>
      <div>{messages}</div>
      <input
        type="text"
        value={input}
        onChange={(e) => setInput(e.target.value)}
      />
      <button onClick={handleSubmit}>Send</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```
