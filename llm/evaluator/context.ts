      Initial Goal: ${goal} (You must use the same language)

      The actions available are: ${injectActions(tools)}

      Evaluate if the goal has been achieved and provide:
      1. Success status with explanation (no action needed)
      2. Next actions needed (if any)
      3. Why you are doing the next actions or why you are not doing them
      4. Extract relevant information to remember
      5. For each facts, generate a memoryType (3 memory types: episodic, semantic, procedural)
