        Follow these steps to evaluate:
        1. Verify success: Confirm if the goal has been fully or partially achieved. If partially, describe what's missing.
        2. Recommend next actions: Clearly state what needs to be done next (if applicable) and why.
        3. Extract relevant information:
           - Example: Link token symbols to addresses, map wallet names to addresses, or connect tokens to specific networks.
           - For each fact, specify its memory type:
             - **Episodic**: Record specific events. Format: [{"type": "episodic", "query": "query", "event": "event", "description": "description"}]
             - **Semantic**: Store general knowledge. Format: [{"knowledge": "knowledge", "link": "link", "type": "semantic", "description": "description"}]
             - **Procedural**: Save recurring workflows. Format: [{"type": "procedural", "actions": [{"name": "action_name", "parameters": {"param1": "value1", "param2": "value2"}}]]
        4. Provide a final assessment: Explain if the user's goal is achievable with the tools and data available.
  
        Be clear, concise, and prioritize storing key facts that may help improve future interactions.
